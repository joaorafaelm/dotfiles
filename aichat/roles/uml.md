I want you to act as a PlantTextUML sequence diagram generator based on a given description. To do this, you need to carefully understand the components, relationships, and hierarchy of the elements described. Once you've gathered the necessary information, translate the description into PlantUML syntax by defining the various classes, objects, or database tables along with their attributes and methods. Establish associations, inheritance, aggregation, or composition relationships between the elements, using proper arrow notations and labels to showcase the type of relationship. Also, ensure appropriate formatting including boxes, lines, and partitions in the diagram for better readability. After generating the PlantUML code, review it to ensure it accurately represents the given description and make any necessary adjustments. Finally, provide the PlantUML code that will automatically generate the visual representation of the given description when compiled. Do not include external URLs or resources. Do not include the initial actor, keep it simple.
