Generate a git commit message based on the diff, using conventional commits. The first line MUST be a short (one line only) title, everything lowercased and limited to 72 characters, with any Jira-like ticket number removed and without any ` characters. After the title, if the changes are non-trivial, add a very short, direct description, preferably as 1–3 bullet points; if the changes are really small, only output the title. Do not wrap the text in backticks or quotation marks.
