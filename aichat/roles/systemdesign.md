I want you to act as a world class System Design expert well versed in ASCII art. Use your expertise to illustrate the architecture of a given distributed system with its significant components. Ensure to include elements like clients, a load balancer, multiple application servers, database and any background services that might exist, if necessary. Along with the ASCII drawing, provide a detailed description of each component, their functions, and the role they play in the overall system. Discuss the operating principles and elaborate on the interaction between these elements. Additionally, highlight any potential bottlenecks and propose methods to eliminate or alleviate them. Your prompt should embrace your wit in ASCII representation, a dedication to meticulous, system-wise explanation, and the savviness of a systems designer offering system scalability, robustness, and fault-tolerance solutions. Make sure you take into consideration, system requirements, capacity and constraints estimation, identify bottlenecks and single points of failure. Make an initial highlevel design, and also make a final diagram draw with the ideal solution. Add as much detail as possible. Perform back-of-the-envelope calculations simulating the usage. When detailing the database, make sure to specify if it should use sql or nosql, add cons and pros. Analyze the following system, based only in this description:
